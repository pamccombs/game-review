    Use constructor methods to allow organization and ease to output attributes of a JS model
Note: There will be a quiz in your assessment on hoisting and scope in vanilla(plain) JavaScript.
[X] research hoisting and scope

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function)

JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

scope

Global variable scope - var - exists throughout entire function
variables declared (using var keyword) are function-level scoped 


Local variable(block-level) scope - let/const only exists in block '{}' 
The variables declared with let or const keyword have the block in which they are declared, as well as any continued sub-blocks as their scope.
ECMAScript 2015 introduced keywords: let and const for block-level scoping in JavaScript.
